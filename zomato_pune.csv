Negative experience 


I have always been a fan of Mac d for its fries with Peri peri 
And I always make it a point to collect it home if I am near to any of their outlets in Pune 

Today noon at 1:40 I entered Mac d camp and placed a order for large fries with peri peri for take away bill no. 183
Order took no time within 2/3 minutes order came and I left for home 

When reaching home I was taken back when I found the peri peri sachet to be torn and shaker to be torn As well from down and things got more worse when I found I was given small fries instead of large 

Not recommending at all this camp outlet 

I request management to look into this

The JM road McD is one of them. Although there are other options are available but still this place is always crowded. In addition to that it's 2 floor place so there is ample of space for sit. So you will definitely get place to sit. Apart from this I don't have to say anything abt food. Because it's already been benchmarked. So if you have problem to sit anywhere McD is there on JM road.,Omkar's Food Diaries,Rated 3.0

Visiting A Mall And Not Eating At The McDonalds sounds a bore. So we tried to sound cliche. Also to try the discontinued Filet-O-Fish Burger At Chennai Outlets.

Dishes Ordered ‚Äî
1) Filet-O-Fish Meal ~ This Filet-O-Fish Burger is heaven. The Fish Pattice is just on point and the Fries With Coke Only Complement. Pick Of The EATOut.
2) Veg McPuff ~ Nicely Made Puff with usual Paneer and veggies stuff.
3) McEgg ~ The Pattice is like double cooked Hakf Boil Egg. Another Decent Burger.
4) McAloo Tikki ~ Very Fresh and essence of Aloo Tikki is also there.

Ambience ~ Usual McDonalds Type Set Up.
Worth For The Price ~ Worth it for the quantity.
Location Accessiblity ~ Is Located On Lower Ground Of Mall.
Service ~ Self Service.
Hygiene ~ Yes,it‚Äôs hygiene.
Washroom ~ Washroom is Of mall.

Overall -
I just went for The Filet-O-Fish Because I Love That.",Iam AK(Anaikomagan),Rated 4.0
